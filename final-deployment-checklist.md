## Final Notes

The portfolio website is well-structured and nearly ready for deployment. Two key improvements to complete before final deployment:

1. **WebP Conversion**: Currently only 212 of 509 images (~41%) have WebP alternatives. Consider running the image optimization process again to create WebP versions for all images.

2. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Thoroughly test the site in all major browsers to ensure consistent appearance and functionality.

When deploying, GitHub Pages is recommended for its simplicity, free hosting, and integration with GitHub Actions for automated deployment whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
