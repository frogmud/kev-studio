                <p>In 2021, International Paper spun off its $3 billion global uncoated freesheet paper business, forming Sylvamoâ€”the world's largest pure-play paper company. As Design Lead at Thackway McCord, I collaborated closely with Executive Creative Director Kat McCord, Creative Director Steve Clarke, and strategists Simon Thackway and Jonathan Paisner to develop a brand that would position Sylvamo as a leader in the paper industry.</p>
                
                <p>The name "Sylvamo," derived from the Latin words silva (forest) and amo (love), reflects the company's commitment to sustainable forestry and its passion for paper. The visual identity features a distinctive paper plane icon symbolizing aspiration and progress, set against a vibrant purple palette that differentiates Sylvamo in a market often dominated by green hues.</p>
                
                <p>Throughout the engagement, I oversaw the development of the logo, motion graphics, and print materials, ensuring a cohesive and impactful brand presence across all touchpoints.</p>`
