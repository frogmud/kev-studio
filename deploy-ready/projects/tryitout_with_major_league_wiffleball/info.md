## Description
Five adult men play in a wiffleball tournament on Long Island; will branding help give them the edge they need?

The logo itself is a traditional-feeling cursive sports logo, aligned by the identical 't' used at the beginning, middle, and end. Bright green as the team colors works to reflect the feeling of playing ball in the yard.

Despite our branding efforts, we lost in the semi-finals to 16-year olds.

## Timeline
- **Challenge**: Create an identity for an amateur wiffleball team competing in a tournament
- **Approach**: Develop a distinctive sports brand with traditional baseball aesthetics
- **Deliverables**: Logo design, team shirts, custom cards, website graphics
- **Results**: Enhanced team spirit and cohesion, though ultimately defeated by superior teen athleticism
