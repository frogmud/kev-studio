In 2018, the United Nations President of the General Assembly (PGA) initiated a new diplomatic dialogue format called "Morning Minga" to foster more collaborative and informal exchanges between UN representatives. This innovative project required a comprehensive brand identity that would honor the UN's diplomatic gravitas while introducing a fresh, approachable visual language for this new initiative.

The Morning Minga dialogues represented a significant shift in diplomatic communication at the UN, creating spaces where ambassadors and representatives could engage in more personal, candid discussions about pressing global issues outside the formal assembly structure. Our team was tasked with developing a complete brand identity package that would:

- Create a distinctive visual identity that balanced UN heritage with a fresh, contemporary approach
- Design flexible branding elements that could be implemented across physical and digital touchpoints
- Develop a system that would appeal to diplomats from diverse cultural backgrounds
- Establish brand guidelines that could be consistently applied by the UN's internal team

The resulting identity system centered on a vibrant, multi-colored logo that symbolized dialogue and diversity, while maintaining clear connections to UN visual traditions. The name "Minga" itself, referring to a South American tradition of community gatherings, perfectly captured the initiative's collaborative spirit.
