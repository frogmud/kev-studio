Finseca emerged from the merger of two long-standing industry groups, AALU and GAMA. As design lead focused on motion and UI/UX, I partnered with the Thackway McCord team—Kat McCord, Fuchen Kuang, Simon Thackway and Jonathan Paisner—with 3D support from Scyld Bowring and web development by WDG. The shield icon underscores protection while the double-F mark represents the two groups coming together. A purple palette places the DC-based group in a politically neutral position.

The brand identity needed to represent a unified voice for the financial security profession while establishing a distinctive presence in Washington DC's advocacy landscape. My role guided every visual touchpoint from naming to motion, creating a system that resonates with both industry veterans and newcomers.

--- TIMELINE ---

### Strategic discovery
As design lead, I conducted stakeholder interviews, competitive analysis and member research with the Thackway McCord team to identify key opportunities for the merged organization. We explored the evolving landscape of financial security advocacy to position Finseca effectively.

### Naming & brand development
I led the creation of the distinctive "Finseca" name through a collaborative process with leadership from both legacy organizations. Together we developed a comprehensive brand strategy centered around the concept of "financial security for all."

### Visual identity creation
I designed the shield-based logo with integrated double-F symbolism, representing both protection and the merger of two organizations. Working closely with Fuchen Kuang, we developed a strategic color system with politically neutral purple as the primary brand color.

### Digital experience design
I shaped the website architecture, user interface and content strategy to communicate Finseca's mission. Partnering with WDG, we created dynamic digital templates for ongoing content development.

### Motion & 3D development
I created distinctive 3D animations of the shield mark for video content and digital applications. Working with Scyld Bowring, we developed motion guidelines for consistent animation across platforms.

### Launch campaign
I designed comprehensive launch materials including announcement videos, digital marketing assets and member communications. Working with the entire Thackway McCord team, we coordinated rollout across multiple channels to effectively introduce the new organization.
