Every holiday season, Thackway McCord partners with an artist to create a series of chocolate bars for clients. In 2021 I pitched drawing custom QR codes linking to fun, branded URLs. Serving as art director, designer, illustrator, motion artist and developer, I transformed these utilitarian codes into playful portraits of pets. The Thackway McCord team collaborated with Monotype to pair Cotford with the glitchy codes, and the gifs even gained traction on Giphy. Most importantly, my cat Bean starred in the case study next to his illustration.
