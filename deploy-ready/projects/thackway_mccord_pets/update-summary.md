## Overall Approach
The update maintained the existing structure and most visual elements while refining the written content. After the initial update, we made additional changes:

1. Changed the client name from "Thackway McCord" to "Rosie and Bean" for a more specific attribution
2. Modified the packaging design section to use a more personal tone with first-person perspective

These changes create a better balance between professional description and personal involvement, highlighting both the project's recognition and the designer's direct contribution while streamlining the visual presentation.
