For the 2021 holiday season, AIGA New York commissioned a festive wrapping paper design centered around the theme of 'joy.' The project presented an opportunity to blend traditional print design with interactive digital experiences through cleverly integrated QR codes.

We secured the memorable domain joyjoyjoyjoyjoy.com and built a series of scannable QR codes that maintained their functionality while being visually transformed into festive holiday motifs. Each QR code linked to a custom-built animation that extended the visual language of the wrapping paper into the digital realm.

As the design, programming, motion and print lead, I collaborated closely with the Thackway McCord team under creative director Kat McCord to merge tactile and digital elements.

### Concept development
Explored the intersection of functional QR technology with decorative holiday motifs. Developed multiple approaches to create scannable yet visually cohesive patterns that embodied the joy theme.

### Technical exploration
Tested various QR code modifications to determine the threshold of visual alteration while maintaining functionality. Developed a system that ensured all codes would scan reliably across different devices.

### Animation production
Created lightweight Lottie animations that would autoplay immediately after scanning, providing a seamless transition from physical to digital experience. Optimized for mobile performance to ensure quick loading.

### Pattern design
Developed repeating patterns using the festive QR codes as the primary motif. Created variations that worked visually while maintaining the interactive functionality of each code in the pattern.

### Print production
Prepared specifications for high-quality wrapping paper production. Collaborated with manufacturers to ensure print quality preserved the scannable functionality of the embedded codes.

### Digital implementation
Built a responsive landing page at joyjoyjoyjoyjoy.com to host the animations. Created a streamlined user experience that worked instantly after scanning the QR codes from the wrapping paper.
