Sylvamo is the world's paper company, honoring the promise of paper to educate, communicate and entertain – sustainably. The name was created by Thackway McCord when the business spun off from International Paper, forming the world's largest pure play paper producer.

The brand combines the Latin words for forest, *silva*, and love, *amo*, expressing a deep respect for sustainable forestry. A paper plane icon symbolizes aspiration while a vibrant purple palette sets the identity apart in a sea of green.
