MN8 Energy emerged from Goldman Sachs's decision to spin out its renewable energy business, creating a paradigm-shifting opportunity in the clean energy sector. As the enterprise renewable energy leader, MN8 is dedicated to making energy smarter, cleaner, more accessible, and more efficient.

The name "MN8" (pronounced "minute") represents both energy's constant motion and the company's innovative approach to power generation and distribution. The clever phonetic wordplay connects to the concept of time while visually incorporating the number 8, which resembles an infinity symbol when turned horizontally - suggesting unlimited potential.

The logo design features a brilliant negative space treatment where the "8" cleverly doubles as both a colon and a power socket, visually communicating the company's core business of energy delivery. The "all orange everything" brand approach gives MN8 a bold, distinctive presence in an industry often dominated by conservative blue and green palettes.
As the design, logo, motion, and UI/UX lead, I partnered with the Thackway McCord team—Kat McCord, Steve Clarke, Lucinda Quartararo, Dave Morreale, Simon Thackway, and Jonathan Paisner—to steer the brand from naming through launch.

I worked extensively on naming exploration, logo concepting, website design, design systems implementation, and brand guidelines development. My contributions helped translate the strategic vision into cohesive visual assets that positioned MN8 as a forward-thinking energy innovator.
