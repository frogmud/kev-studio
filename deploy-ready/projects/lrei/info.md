As design lead for print and motion at Thackway McCord, I was tasked with translating LREI's 15-year experience into a concise viewbook.

We began with a Flickr archive of around 5,000 photos and minimal text guidance. Under Kat McCord's creative direction, our team shaped the imagery and narrative into a piece parents could tuck into a pocket.

The final run of ten thousand viewbooks is still being handed out today. ðŸ˜Ž
