Silicon Valley mixes with Wall Street in Hum's 'capital as a service' business model, designed to help SMBs raise money faster and more easily. A comprehensive rebrand provided 'Capital', as they were known, with a new name, logo, visual identity and website that capture their iconoclastic, AI-driven, ground-levelling proposition.

The identity system balances technological innovation with financial expertise, creating a distinctive brand voice in the crowded fintech space. A vibrant color palette and dynamic visual elements reflect Hum's mission to bring energy and accessibility to business funding.

As the lead designer overseeing logo, design and UI/UX, I collaborated closely with the Thackway McCord team throughout each phase of the project.

--- TIMELINE ---

### Discovery & strategy
I partnered with strategists Simon Thackway and Jonathan Paisner to kick things off. The project began with extensive stakeholder interviews and market analysis to understand the fintech landscape and Capital's unique positioning. Key insights revealed the need for a brand that could stand out in a crowded market while communicating complex financial offerings in an approachable way.

### Naming development
Working with creative director Kat McCord and lead designer Bianca Seong, we explored new names. The naming process transformed "Capital" into the more distinctive and ownable "Hum." The new name evokes both technological connectivity and the constant flow of capital—central to the company's value proposition. It also carries connotations of activity, energy, and momentum.

### Logo & visual identity
Bianca Seong executed the logo under Kat McCord's direction while I shaped the broader system. The visual identity system was designed to balance tech innovation with financial credibility. The logo features a distinctive wordmark with custom letterforms that convey both stability and forward momentum. A vibrant color palette of purples, blues, and teals creates a fresh look that stands apart from traditional financial blues and greens.

### App icon & mobile interface
I led the design of the Hum mobile experience and app icon, creating a touchpoint that seamlessly extended the brand across platforms. Working with Scyld Bowring, we crafted the app icon to balance recognizability with the technical constraints of mobile interfaces.

### Motion design principles
I developed a comprehensive motion language for Hum that reinforced their brand values. Working with Scyld Bowring, we created animations that expressed energy, connection, and forward momentum—all critical elements of Hum's positioning in the financial technology marketplace.

### Digital experience design
I worked with developer Dave Morreale to bring the UI to life. The responsive website design effectively communicates Hum's complex offerings in an accessible way. The user experience guides potential clients through the funding process with clear navigation and compelling visual storytelling.

### Brand application system
Our design team produced versatile templates and collateral. A comprehensive set of brand applications was developed to ensure consistent implementation across all touchpoints. This included digital templates, presentation decks, social media assets, and print collateral.

### Interactive presentations
I designed interactive presentation templates that helped the Hum team tell their story to investors and clients. These presentations incorporated subtle animations and data visualizations to explain Hum's complex AI-driven matching process in a compelling and understandable way.

### Brand guidelines & design system
I consolidated the components in a Figma library. A robust design system was developed with reusable components and clear documentation. The brand guidelines document provides comprehensive rules for logo usage, typography, color application, photography style, and voice and tone.

### Digital advertising
I developed a cohesive digital advertising system that maintained the Hum brand across various platforms while adapting to different format requirements. These ads effectively communicated Hum's value proposition to target audiences while maintaining strong brand recognition.

### Launch & market reception
Scyld Bowring created energetic 3D assets for the launch. The phased rollout of the new brand across all channels was carefully coordinated to maximize impact. The rebrand was well-received in the market, helping Hum to secure additional funding and attract new clients.
