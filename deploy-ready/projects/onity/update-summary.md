### HTML Structure Fixes
- Fixed nested div structure issues that appeared after edits
- Restructured the HTML to ensure proper section organization
- Ensured all timeline items maintain the correct hierarchy

## Technical Implementation
- Created and executed multiple JavaScript scripts:
  1. `fix-onity-metadata.js`: Updated metadata fields and main content
  2. `fix-onity-timeline.js`: Updated timeline items while preserving images
  3. `fix-onity-add-animation.js`: Added back the animation as final deliverable
  4. `fix-onity-final.js`: Fixed HTML structure issues

## Result
The Onity project page now correctly displays all content with proper HTML structure, with the final animation positioned at the end of the timeline as requested.
