Programming financial reformBack in 2016, the Department of Labor announced that all fees, decisions, and transactions made by financial advisors would need to be disclosed to their clients. Historically, this data had always been opaque — how should we gather and present it?On the Statement Reporting team at Fiserv, we used a combo of code (in APL and PostScript) and design (in Exstream) to create dynamically-generated reports for millions of people. 
To create a new digital product to meet the DOL’s new law, it took five months of producing a slew of new functions, design templates, product sales pitches, QA reports and load testing scenarios before we were finally ready for launch.
But, the Trump administration won election and froze the new law before finally killing it off.
