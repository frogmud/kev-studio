As the project's director, illustrator, designer, motion and game designer, I transformed my brother James's DnD campaigns into a vibrant set of character animations. Bright, saturated colors with thick outlines keep the work scalable while maintaining a playful vibe. The long-term goal is a video game demo with a full-color intro, but hand-drawn animation is slow going. After months of drawing only black and white sprites, I polished what I had to submit for Young Guns 21 (no shortlist sadly). Special thanks to Brian Appleby, Keith Hagins, Chris Stratton, Ryan Hawk, and James Grzejka for their ongoing feedback. I still hope to revisit the project someday.
