## Image Processing Status
All main project images have been downloaded from kev.studio and are available in:
- Raw format in `/Users/kevin/Desktop/PORTFOLIO/kev-studio-images/`
- Processed format in `/Users/kevin/Desktop/PORTFOLIO/kev-portfolio-organized/images/processed/`

## Recommendations

1. **Create Missing Pages:**
   - Create HTML pages for Google, Hum, and TMX projects
   - These projects have images but lack detailed content information

2. **Enhance Existing Pages:**
   - Consider adding more detailed project descriptions where applicable
   - Add secondary images for projects with multiple artifacts
   - Implement lazy-loading on all project images for faster page loads

3. **Navigation Improvements:**
   - Update the main index.html page to include all projects
   - Ensure consistent navigation between project pages
   - Check that all "Previous" and "Next" navigation links work correctly

4. **Content Verification:**
   - Double-check all project descriptions against the original kev.studio site
   - Verify dates, client names, and roles for accuracy

5. **Manual Content Collection:**
   - Visit kev.studio directly to collect any missing detailed information for Google, Hum, and TMX projects
   - Look for any additional images that might enhance project presentations

## Conclusion
The portfolio is approximately 80% complete with the majority of projects fully implemented. The remaining work focuses on creating pages for 3 projects and enhancing the overall site navigation. All major images have been successfully downloaded from kev.studio.
