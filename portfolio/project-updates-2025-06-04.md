## Project Generator Protection

We've updated the unified-project-generator.js script to protect enhanced pages from being overwritten:

1. Added a PROTECTED_PROJECTS array that explicitly lists projects to skip
2. Added detection for the `<!-- ENHANCED -->` comment marker
3. Added console logging to show which projects are being skipped and why

## Next Steps

For future enhancement of additional project pages:

1. Add the `<!-- ENHANCED -->` comment near the top of the HTML file
2. Consider adding the project ID to the PROTECTED_PROJECTS array in unified-project-generator.js
3. Update the portfolio-progress-report.md to mark the project as enhanced

## Timeline UI Pattern

The timeline UI pattern has been established across multiple projects and includes:

### Basic Timeline Item:
```html
<div class="project-timeline">
  <div class="timeline-item">
    <h3>Phase Title</h3>
    <p>Phase description text.</p>
    <img loading="lazy" src="../path/to/image.jpg" alt="Description" class="timeline-image">
  </div>
  <!-- Additional timeline items -->
</div>
```

### Timeline Item with Animation Preview:
For large GIFs or animations, use this pattern to provide a static preview with a link to the full animation:
```html
<div class="timeline-item">
  <h3>Animation Phase</h3>
  <p>Phase description text.</p>
  <figure class="timeline-figure">
    <img loading="lazy" src="../path/to/static-preview.png" alt="Description" class="timeline-image">
    <figcaption><a href="../path/to/full-animation.gif" target="_blank">View Animation</a></figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
```

These patterns should be followed for consistency when enhancing additional project pages.
