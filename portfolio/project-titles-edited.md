## Title Patterns

Several patterns appear in the project titles:
1. **Client Name Only**: Simple titles that use just the client name (e.g., "Abra", "L3Harris")
2. **Client Name + Description**: Titles that include both client and project type (e.g., "LREI Viewbook")
3. **Concept-Based**: Titles that focus on the concept rather than the client (e.g., "Making QR codes fun!")
4. **Benefit-Focused**: Titles that emphasize the value proposition (e.g., "A better way to fund growth")

When creating new project titles, consider which pattern best fits the project's nature and client preferences.
