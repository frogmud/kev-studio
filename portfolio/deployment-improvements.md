# Portfolio Deployment Improvements

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the improvements made to the portfolio deployment process and local development workflow.

### 1. Local Development Server

A robust Node.js static file server was implemented with the following features:

- Simple, lightweight HTTP server for local development
- Content-type detection for all portfolio file types (HTML, CSS, JS, images, videos, etc.)
- Security headers including Content-Security-Policy
- CORS support for development
- Error handling and detailed logging
- Directory traversal prevention
- Default port 3000 with environment variable override option

### 2. GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow

A GitHub Actions workflow was created to automate the portfolio deployment:

- Automatic deployment on push to main branch
- Manual trigger option via workflow_dispatch
- Dependency caching for faster builds
- Conditional image optimization to avoid redundant processing
- Proper GitHub Pages environment configuration

### 3. Package Management

The following improvements were made to the package management:

- Added 'serve' script in package.json for easy local development
- Verified dependency requirements for image optimization

### 4. Documentation

- Updated README.md with accurate instructions for local development
- Added detailed inline documentation for the server implementation
- Created this summary document for future reference

## Usage

### Local Development

To run the portfolio locally:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Deployment

The portfolio is automatically deployed when changes are pushed to the main branch. For manual deployment, you can trigger the "Deploy Portfolio" workflow from the GitHub Actions tab.

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements could include:

- Live reloading for local development
- Better image optimization with customizable settings
- Support for environment-specific configurations
- Performance analytics and reporting
