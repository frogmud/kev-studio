A short story written by my brother based on five years of DnD campaigns inspired a series of character animations. Bright, saturated colors with thick outlines keep the work scalable while maintaining a playful vibe. The long term goal is a video game demo with a full color intro, but hand drawn animation is slow going. After months of drawing only black and white sprites, I polished what I had to submit for Young Guns 21 (no shortlist sadly). My hands needed a break, yet I still hope to revisit the project someday.
