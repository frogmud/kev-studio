Five adult men play in a wiffleball tournament on Long Island; will branding help give them the edge they need?

The logo itself is a traditional-feeling cursive sports logo, aligned by the identical 't' used at the beginning, middle, and end. Bright green as the team colors works to reflect the feeling of playing ball in the yard.
