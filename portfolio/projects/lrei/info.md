We were given access to a Flickr account with around 5,000 photos and some suggestions for text. As long as the final result would help parents understand life at LREI and then fit in their pocket, most ideas were fair game. The final result was a batch of ten thousand viewbooks that LREI is still handing out today. ðŸ˜Ž
