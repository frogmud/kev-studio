When L3 Technologies and Harris announced their merger in late 2018, it represented the largest defense merger in history, creating the sixth largest defense company in the world. This new powerhouse needed a brand identity that would communicate scale, resources, and capabilities, while differentiating itself from dominant competitors in the space.

The new L3Harris brand faced several key challenges:

- Unite the shared vision of two CEOs and leadership teams
- Provide a foundation where two systems, cultures, and employee groups could integrate seamlessly
- Create a distinctive visual identity in a category dominated by established players
- Develop all brand elements in a climate of total confidentiality

Our team approached this significant project with a comprehensive strategy that moved from discovery through development and implementation. The resulting identity system balanced technical precision with forward-looking innovation – reflecting L3Harris's position at the intersection of defense, technology, and aerospace.

The logo design and visual system evoke technological advancement while maintaining the gravitas expected of a major defense contractor. The identity extends cohesively across digital platforms, physical environments, and communications materials – from exhibition booths and signage to digital interfaces and collateral.

One of the most rewarding aspects of this project was seeing the brand come to life on launch day, as thousands of employees across both legacy companies embraced their new unified identity.
