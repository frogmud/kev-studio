## Description

In 2018, the United Nations President of the General Assembly (PGA) initiated a new diplomatic dialogue format called "Morning Minga" to foster more collaborative and informal exchanges between UN representatives. This innovative project required a comprehensive brand identity that would honor the UN's diplomatic gravitas while introducing a fresh, approachable visual language for this new initiative.

The Morning Minga dialogues represented a significant shift in diplomatic communication at the UN, creating spaces where ambassadors and representatives could engage in more personal, candid discussions about pressing global issues outside the formal assembly structure. Our team was tasked with developing a complete brand identity package that would:

- Create a distinctive visual identity that balanced UN heritage with a fresh, contemporary approach
- Design flexible branding elements that could be implemented across physical and digital touchpoints
- Develop a system that would appeal to diplomats from diverse cultural backgrounds
- Establish brand guidelines that could be consistently applied by the UN's internal team

The resulting identity system centered on a vibrant, multi-colored logo that symbolized dialogue and diversity, while maintaining clear connections to UN visual traditions. The name "Minga" itself, referring to a South American tradition of community gatherings, perfectly captured the initiative's collaborative spirit.

Our work extended across multiple applications, including:

- Logo design with comprehensive color variations
- Print materials including banners, pins, informational leaflets, and social media cards
- Digital assets for website, email communications, and social media
- Environmental graphics for the UN headquarters
- Brand guidelines for consistent implementation

This project represented a unique opportunity to evolve the visual language of international diplomacy while respecting the gravitas and significance of the United Nations. The Morning Minga identity successfully helped launch this new diplomatic initiative, creating a welcoming and distinctive visual presence that encouraged participation from representatives across the global community.
