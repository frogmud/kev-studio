In 2018, the United Nations President of the General Assembly (PGA) initiated a new diplomatic dialogue format called "Morning Minga" to foster more collaborative and informal exchanges between UN representatives. This project required a comprehensive brand identity that would honor the UN's diplomatic gravitas while introducing a fresh, approachable visual language for this new initiative.

The resulting identity system centered on a vibrant, multi-colored logo that symbolized dialogue and diversity, while maintaining clear connections to UN visual traditions. The name "Minga" itself, referring to a South American tradition of community gatherings, perfectly captured the initiative's collaborative spirit.

Our work extended across multiple applications, including logo design, print materials, digital assets, environmental graphics, and brand guidelines.
