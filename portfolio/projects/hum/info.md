Silicon Valley mixes with Wall Street in Hum's 'capital as a service' business model, designed to help SMBs raise money faster and more easily. A comprehensive rebrand provided 'Capital', as they were known, with a new name, logo, visual identity and website that capture their iconoclastic, AI-driven, ground-levelling proposition.

The identity system balances technological innovation with financial expertise, creating a distinctive brand voice in the crowded fintech space. A vibrant color palette and dynamic visual elements reflect Hum's mission to bring energy and accessibility to business funding.
