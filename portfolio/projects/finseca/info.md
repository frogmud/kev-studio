Finseca emerged from the merger of two long-standing industry groups, AALU and GAMA. The new organization champions financial security professionals and seeks to elevate the profession. The shield icon underscores protection while the double-F mark represents the two groups coming together. A purple palette places the DC-based group in a politically neutral position.

The brand identity needed to represent a unified voice for the financial security profession while establishing a distinctive presence in Washington DC's advocacy landscape. The design approach balanced professionalism with accessibility, creating a system that would resonate with both industry veterans and newcomers to the profession.
