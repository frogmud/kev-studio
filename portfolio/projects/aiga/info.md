For the 2021 holidays, the AIGA wanted to sell wrapping paper around the theme of “joy.” We built joyjoyjoyjoyjoy.com and created festive QR codes that link to a lightweight lottie animation based on the code artwork. The codes were repeated to form wrapping paper patterns—each scannable and linking back to the animation.
