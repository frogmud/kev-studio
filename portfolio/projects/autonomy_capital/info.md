Autonomy Capital approached our team to craft a modern identity that reflects their innovative investment philosophy. We developed a flexible visual system and responsive website that communicate trust and long‑term vision.

The clean typography and restrained color palette emphasize the firm's commitment to clarity and transparency, while subtle motion graphics add a sense of momentum.

Throughout the engagement my role spanned design, web and strategy. I led brand definition workshops, collaborated with Autonomy's marketing team and oversaw the build of the responsive site alongside our in‑house developers.

The project was a collaborative effort between our studio and Autonomy's internal stakeholders, ensuring the new identity resonated across every touchpoint.
