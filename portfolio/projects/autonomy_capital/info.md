Autonomy Capital approached our team to craft a modern identity that reflects their innovative investment philosophy. We developed a flexible visual system and responsive website that communicate trust and longâ€‘term vision.

The clean typography and restrained color palette emphasize the firm's commitment to clarity and transparency, while subtle motion graphics add a sense of momentum.
