Lifepoint is a national for-profit healthcare provider, operating in 89 communities across the United States. The network is deeply connected to the towns it serves, where hospitals are as vital to local infrastructure as roads and schools.

The heart motif created the foundation for a flexible identity system applied through a palette of clean white and vibrant colors. A rigorously developed library of crop configurations originates from the dot motif.
