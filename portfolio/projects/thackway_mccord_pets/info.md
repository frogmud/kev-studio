Every holiday season, Thackway McCord partners with an artist to create a series of chocolate bars for clients. In 2021 I pitched drawing custom QR codes linking to fun, branded URLs. The pandemic made the codes ubiquitous, but mostly utilitarian, so we set out to make them playful. What began as abstract drawings evolved into portraits of pets accompanied by 8‑bit style gifs and stickers. Monotype loved the mix of Cotford with the glitchy codes, and the gifs even gained traction on Giphy. Most importantly, my cat Bean starred in the case study next to his illustration.
