## Tagline

A short story written by my brother led to a deep dive into character animation.


## Main Content

Eyes Above is a personal project that began with a short story penned by my brother, James Grzejka, inspired by our years of Dungeons & Dragons campaigns. As the project's director, illustrator, designer, motion, and game designer, I transformed this narrative into a vibrant set of character animations.

Bright, saturated colors with thick outlines were employed to maintain scalability and a playful aesthetic. The long-term goal is to develop a video game demo featuring a full-color intro sequence. However, the hand-drawn animation process is time-intensive. After months of creating black-and-white sprites, I polished the existing work and submitted it to Young Guns 21. Although it was not shortlisted, the project received valuable feedback and remains a work in progress.

Special thanks to Brian Appleby, Keith Hagins, Chris Stratton, Ryan Hawk, and James Grzejka for their ongoing feedback and support. I hope to revisit and expand upon this project in the future.

Designing regulatory compliance tools for financial advisors


## Main Content

In 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) introduced the Fiduciary Rule, aiming to enhance transparency in the financial advisory industry by requiring advisors to act in their clients' best interests and disclose all fees and conflicts of interest. This regulatory shift necessitated significant changes in how financial institutions reported and communicated information to clients.

As a member of Fiserv's Statement Reporting team, I contributed to developing a comprehensive digital solution to assist financial institutions in complying with these new regulations. Our objective was to create intuitive reporting tools that presented complex financial data clearly and accessibly while adhering to strict regulatory requirements.

## Timeline

### Regulatory research & analysis

Collaborated with legal and compliance teams to interpret the DOL's Fiduciary Rule, translating complex regulatory requirements into actionable design and functionality specifications. This foundational work ensured our solutions met both legal standards and user needs.


### Technical architecture

Developed a technical framework utilizing APL (A Programming Language) and PostScript to generate dynamic, personalized reports. The architecture was designed to handle high volumes of data and integrate seamlessly with existing financial advisor workflows.


### User experience design

Designed a modular report structure emphasizing clarity and usability. Incorporated plain-language explanations and visual representations of fee structures and investment performance to make complex financial data understandable to clients.


### Development & programming

Implemented new functions in APL to extract and process necessary data points from financial systems. Developed templates populated dynamically, ensuring accurate and personalized reporting for each client.


### Testing & quality assurance

Conducted rigorous testing across various data conditions and edge cases to ensure reliability and compliance. Performed load testing to verify the system's capability to handle nationwide deployment demands.


### Client preparation & sales support

Created sales and marketing materials to aid Fiserv's account teams in preparing financial institution clients for the new regulatory environment. Developed demonstration materials, implementation guides, and training resources to facilitate client onboarding.


### Project resolution

After months of development, our solution was ready for deployment. However, following the 2016 election, the incoming administration delayed and eventually nullified the Fiduciary Rule. Despite this, the systems and insights developed were repurposed for other financial transparency initiatives within Fiserv.

### Design process documentation

Maintained comprehensive documentation of the design and development process, including sketches, wireframes, and notes. These assets served as valuable references for future financial reporting projects.


### Lessons & impact

This project underscored the challenges of developing solutions in a rapidly changing regulatory environment. While the Fiduciary Rule was ultimately withdrawn, the experience enhanced Fiserv's capabilities in creating transparent financial reporting systems and prepared the company for future regulatory changes in the financial industry.

## Main Content

MN8 Energy was established in 2022 as an independent entity following its spin-off from Goldman Sachs Renewable Power LLC.

The innovative approach garnered industry recognition, including an Indigo Design Award in 2021 and a Communication Arts Illustration shortlist .



## Timeline

### Concept development & creative direction

The project began with the idea of reimagining QR codes—ubiquitous during the pandemic—as playful, hand-drawn pet portraits. This approach aimed to infuse a sense of delight into a typically utilitarian element.


### QR code illustration & development

Crafting a bold brand identity for a recreational sports tournament

## Main Content

Try It Out is a semi-professional wiffleball league formed by a group of friends in NJ who transformed a casual weekend activity into an organized competitive venture with its own distinctive visual identity. The brand development embraced both the DIY spirit of the league and the nostalgic connection to classic sports card collecting, creating a cohesive system that worked across physical and digital touchpoints.

The core challenge was balancing the playful, grassroots nature of the sport with a professional-looking identity system that would elevate the experience for participants and spectators alike.


## Timeline

### Brand Identity Development

The visual identity process began with exploring typography that could convey both athleticism and a sense of community. The resulting logo system features bold, condensed lettering with a distinctive angle that suggests forward momentum—a key attribute for a sports brand. The typography system was complemented by a color palette dominated by bold primary colors reminiscent of classic baseball design language.


### Trading Card System

The most distinctive aspect of the Try It Out brand was the player trading card system. Each league participant received their own personalized trading card featuring portrait photography against a vibrant background and custom stats. The cards served multiple purposes: they reinforced team identity, created collectible memorabilia, and provided a novel way to introduce players to one another at events.

### Apparel & Merchandise

To further establish the league's identity, a limited run of merchandise was created, including jerseys and t-shirts. The apparel featured the Try It Out logo prominently and used the established color palette consistently. These items weren't just promotional materials—they helped create a sense of community and team spirit among participants while increasing visibility in public spaces.

### Digital Media & Promotion

The league established a digital presence through social media and a simple website to announce game schedules, share results, and showcase player profiles. The digital content maintained the brand's visual language established in the physical assets, creating a consistent experience across all touchpoints. Short promotional videos were created for social sharing, featuring highlights from games and player interviews.

### Game Day Experience

The brand identity extended to the in-person experience at games, where branded scorecards, signage, and other game-day materials helped create an immersive atmosphere. These elements transformed what could have been a casual park gathering into a more structured sporting event, enhancing the experience for both players and spectators.

### Impact & Community Building

What began as a casual weekend activity evolved into a recognizable brand with its own community. The Try It Out league demonstrates how thoughtful design can elevate even grassroots recreational activities into meaningful experiences. The project showcases the power of branding to transform simple gatherings into organized communities with shared identity and purpose.

Visual identity for the 73rd President of the General Assembly

## Main Content

In 2018, the United Nations President of the General Assembly (PGA) introduced "Morning Minga," a new diplomatic dialogue format aimed at fostering collaborative and informal exchanges among UN representatives. This initiative required a comprehensive brand identity that honored the UN's diplomatic gravitas while introducing a fresh, approachable visual language.

The term "Minga" refers to a South American tradition of community gatherings, reflecting the initiative's collaborative spirit and the Ecuadorian heritage of the 73rd PGA, María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés. The design team at Thackway McCord, including creative director Kat McCord, strategist Simon Thackway, and design lead Kevin Grzejka, developed a complete brand identity package encompassing logo design, digital applications, and print collateral.

The resulting identity system centered on a vibrant, multi-colored logo symbolizing dialogue and diversity, while maintaining clear connections to UN visual traditions. This branding was implemented across various platforms, including environmental graphics within UN spaces, digital media, and printed materials, ensuring a cohesive and inclusive representation of the Morning Minga initiative.

## Timeline

### Strategic briefing & concept development

The project commenced with in-depth research into UN protocols and the PGA's vision for the Morning Minga dialogues. The name "Minga" provided an authentic connection to the President's Ecuadorian heritage and embodied the collaborative essence of the initiative.


### Logo design & visual system

A vibrant, multi-colored logo system was developed to represent dialogue, diversity, and the global nature of the UN community. The design balanced formal diplomatic requirements with a contemporary approach, distinguishing it from traditional UN communications.


### Logo animation

An animated version of the logo was created to bring energy and movement to digital applications. The animation concept reflected the gathering of diverse perspectives central to the Morning Minga concept.


### Printed materials

A comprehensive suite of materials, including banners, leaflets, and diplomatic correspondence templates, was produced. These materials adhered to UN protocol and functioned in multiple languages while conveying the inclusive spirit of the Morning Minga sessions.


### Digital applications

The brand extended to digital platforms, encompassing social media graphics, email templates, and presentation decks. These assets were designed for adaptability by the UN's internal communications team, ensuring visual consistency across all touchpoints.


### Environmental graphics

The identity was implemented throughout key UN spaces, such as the General Assembly hall and meeting rooms. Environmental applications respected the historic architecture while establishing a recognizable presence for the Morning Minga initiative.


### Success & expansion

The Morning Minga identity received positive feedback from diplomats and UN staff for effectively balancing tradition with innovation. The format and branding became a signature initiative of the 73rd PGA, promoting more collaborative dialogue among member states.
