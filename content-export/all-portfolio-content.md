Holiday wrapping paper design with interactive QR codes

## Main Content

For the 2021 holiday season, AIGA New York commissioned a festive wrapping paper design centered around the theme of 'joy.' The project presented an opportunity to blend traditional print design with interactive digital experiences through cleverly integrated QR codes.

We secured the memorable domain joyjoyjoyjoyjoy.com and built a series of scannable QR codes that maintained their functionality while being visually transformed into festive holiday motifs. Each QR code linked to a custom-built animation that extended the visual language of the wrapping paper into the digital realm.

As the design, programming, motion and print lead, I worked closely with the Thackway McCord team under creative director Kat McCord to merge tactile and digital elements.

✨ Dark mode recommended for optimal viewing of this project.

The challenge of this project was creating QR codes that could be visually integrated into festive patterns while maintaining their core functionality. We pushed the boundaries of QR code customization, discovering exactly how much visual alteration was possible while ensuring reliable scanning across various devices.

Each code underwent extensive testing to ensure it would function perfectly in real-world scenarios, from different phone models to various lighting conditions, guaranteeing a seamless experience for everyone who received the wrapping paper.

I worked with the Thackway McCord design team to explore the intersection of functional QR technology with decorative holiday motifs. Developed multiple approaches to create scannable yet visually cohesive patterns that embodied the joy theme.

Tested various QR code modifications to determine the threshold of visual alteration while maintaining functionality. Developed a system that ensured all codes would scan reliably across different devices.

Created lightweight Lottie animations that would autoplay immediately after scanning, providing a seamless transition from physical to digital experience. Optimized for mobile performance to ensure quick loading.

Developed repeating patterns using the festive QR codes as the primary motif. Created variations that worked visually while maintaining the interactive functionality of each code in the pattern.

Prepared specifications for high-quality wrapping paper production. Collaborated with manufacturers to ensure print quality preserved the scannable functionality of the embedded codes.

Built a responsive landing page at joyjoyjoyjoyjoy.com to host the animations. Created a streamlined user experience that worked instantly after scanning the QR codes from the wrapping paper.

Financial security association rebranding from industry merger

## Main Content

Finseca emerged from the merger of two long-standing industry groups, AALU and GAMA. As design lead focused on motion and UI/UX, I partnered with the Thackway McCord team—Kat McCord, Fuchen Kuang, Simon Thackway and Jonathan Paisner—with 3D support from Scyld Bowring and web development by WDG. The shield icon underscores protection while the double-F mark represents the two groups coming together. A purple palette places the DC-based group in a politically neutral position.

The brand identity needed to represent a unified voice for the financial security profession while establishing a distinctive presence in Washington DC's advocacy landscape. My role guided every visual touchpoint from naming to motion, creating a system that resonates with both industry veterans and newcomers.

The shield icon was crafted to symbolize the protective nature of financial security professionals. It features a subtle double-F mark that represents the merger of the two founding organizations while creating a distinctive, ownable symbol that stands out in the financial services landscape.

The 3D rendering of the shield creates depth and dimension, allowing the mark to be used effectively across digital platforms while maintaining its symbolism of strength and protection.

As design lead, I conducted stakeholder interviews, competitive analysis and member research with the Thackway McCord team to identify key opportunities for the merged organization. We explored the evolving landscape of financial security advocacy to position Finseca effectively.

I led the creation of the distinctive "Finseca" name through a collaborative process with leadership from both legacy organizations. Together we developed a comprehensive brand strategy centered around the concept of "financial security for all."

I designed the shield-based logo with integrated double-F symbolism, representing both protection and the merger of two organizations. Working closely with Fuchen Kuang, we developed a strategic color system with politically neutral purple as the primary brand color.

I shaped the website architecture, user interface and content strategy to communicate Finseca's mission. Partnering with WDG, we created dynamic digital templates for ongoing content development.

I created distinctive 3D animations of the shield mark for video content and digital applications. Working with Scyld Bowring, we developed motion guidelines for consistent animation across platforms.

I designed comprehensive launch materials including announcement videos, digital marketing assets and member communications. Working with the entire Thackway McCord team, we coordinated rollout across multiple channels to effectively introduce the new organization.

As a Washington DC-based advocacy organization, Finseca needed to maintain political neutrality while establishing a strong visual presence. I directed the color strategy, selecting purple as the primary brand color to sit at the intersection of red and blue and visually represent the organization's bipartisan approach.

This color choice extends beyond symbolism to practical applications, helping Finseca navigate the complex political landscape while maintaining effective relationships across the political spectrum.

Designing regulatory compliance tools for financial advisors

## Main Content

In 2016, the Department of Labor announced significant regulatory changes requiring financial advisors to disclose all fees, decisions, and transactions to their clients. This landmark legislation aimed to create transparency in an industry where such data had historically been opaque to consumers.

As part of Fiserv's Statement Reporting team, I worked on developing a comprehensive digital solution to help financial institutions comply with these new regulations. Our challenge was to create intuitive reporting tools that would present complex financial data clearly and accessibly while meeting strict regulatory requirements.

The first phase involved an extensive analysis of the Department of Labor's new fiduciary rule and its implications for financial reporting. Working closely with legal and compliance teams, we translated complex regulatory requirements into actionable design and functionality specifications. This foundation was critical for ensuring that our solution would satisfy both legal requirements and user needs.

We developed a technical approach using a combination of APL (a specialized programming language used in financial systems) and PostScript to create dynamically-generated reports. The architecture needed to handle high volumes of data while allowing for personalized client-specific reporting. Our system was designed to integrate with existing financial advisor workflows while adding the new required transparency components.

The design challenge was substantial: create a reporting interface that would make complex financial data understandable to everyday consumers while giving financial advisors the tools they needed to explain these reports to their clients. We developed a modular report structure with clear hierarchy, plain-language explanations, and visual representations of fee structures and investment performance.

Implementation required creating new functions in APL to extract and process the required data points from financial systems. I worked on both the programming side—writing code to generate the reports—and the design side, creating templates that would be populated dynamically. The development process involved close collaboration with data architects to ensure we were capturing and presenting the right information.

Given the high-stakes nature of financial reporting and regulatory compliance, our QA process was rigorous. I developed test scenarios and conducted extensive testing across various data conditions and edge cases. We performed load testing to ensure the system could handle the volume of reports needed for nationwide deployment, and verified compliance with the detailed requirements of the DOL rule.

As the product neared completion, we created sales and marketing materials to help Fiserv's account teams prepare their financial institution clients for the new regulatory environment. This included developing demonstration materials, implementation guides, and training resources for client-facing staff. Our goal was to position this solution as not just a compliance requirement but as a tool for building greater trust with consumers.

After five months of intensive development, our solution was ready for deployment. However, following the 2016 election, the incoming administration placed a freeze on the new regulations and eventually nullified them entirely. While the product was never fully implemented as intended, the work produced valuable systems and insights that were repurposed for other financial transparency initiatives at Fiserv.

Throughout the project, we maintained extensive documentation of our design thinking and development process. These sketches, wireframes, and notes proved valuable not just for the DOL project but as foundational assets for future financial reporting initiatives. The documentation showed how we approached the challenge of translating regulatory requirements into user-centered designs.

This project demonstrated the challenges of developing solutions in a rapidly changing regulatory environment. Despite the rule being ultimately withdrawn, the work advanced Fiserv's capabilities in creating transparent financial reporting systems and prepared the company for future regulatory changes in the financial industry. The experience provided valuable insights into balancing regulatory compliance with user-centered design—a tension that continues to define financial technology development.

A better way to fund growth

## Main Content

Silicon Valley meets Wall Street in Hum's 'capital as a service' business model, designed to help SMBs raise money faster and more easily. A comprehensive rebrand provided 'Capital', as they were known, with a new name, logo, visual identity and website that capture their iconoclastic, AI-driven, ground-levelling proposition.

The identity system balances technological innovation with financial expertise, creating a distinctive brand voice in the crowded fintech space. A vibrant color palette and dynamic visual elements reflect Hum's mission to bring energy and accessibility to business funding.

As the lead designer overseeing logo, design and UI/UX, I collaborated closely with the Thackway McCord team throughout each phase of the project.

I partnered with strategists Simon Thackway and Jonathan Paisner to kick things off. The project began with extensive stakeholder interviews and market analysis to understand the fintech landscape and Capital's unique positioning. Key insights revealed the need for a brand that could stand out in a crowded market while communicating complex financial offerings in an approachable way.

Working with creative director Kat McCord and lead designer Bianca Seong, we explored new names. The naming process transformed "Capital" into the more distinctive and ownable "Hum." The new name evokes both technological connectivity and the constant flow of capital—central to the company's value proposition. It also carries connotations of activity, energy, and momentum.

Bianca Seong executed the logo under Kat McCord's direction while I shaped the broader system. The visual identity system was designed to balance tech innovation with financial credibility. The logo features a distinctive wordmark with custom letterforms that convey both stability and forward momentum. A vibrant color palette of purples, blues, and teals creates a fresh look that stands apart from traditional financial blues and greens.

I led the design of the Hum mobile experience and app icon, creating a touchpoint that seamlessly extended the brand across platforms. Working with Scyld Bowring, we crafted the app icon to balance recognizability with the technical constraints of mobile interfaces.

I developed a comprehensive motion language for Hum that reinforced their brand values. Working with Scyld Bowring, we created animations that expressed energy, connection, and forward momentum—all critical elements of Hum's positioning in the financial technology marketplace.

I worked with developer Dave Morreale to bring the UI to life. The responsive website design effectively communicates Hum's complex offerings in an accessible way.

## Timeline

### Discovery & strategy

I partnered with strategists Simon Thackway and Jonathan Paisner to kick things off. The project began with extensive stakeholder interviews and market analysis to understand the fintech landscape and Capital's unique positioning. Key insights revealed the need for a brand that could stand out in a crowded market while communicating complex financial offerings in an approachable way.

### Naming development

Working with creative director Kat McCord and lead designer Bianca Seong, we explored new names. The naming process transformed "Capital" into the more distinctive and ownable "Hum." The new name evokes both technological connectivity and the constant flow of capital—central to the company's value proposition. It also carries connotations of activity, energy, and momentum.

### Logo & visual identity

Bianca Seong executed the logo under Kat McCord's direction while I shaped the broader system. The visual identity system was designed to balance tech innovation with financial credibility. The logo features a distinctive wordmark with custom letterforms that convey both stability and forward momentum. A vibrant color palette of purples, blues, and teals creates a fresh look that stands apart from traditional financial blues and greens.

Brand identity for the largest defense merger in history

## Main Content

When L3 Technologies and Harris announced their merger in late 2018, it represented the largest defense merger in history, creating the sixth largest defense company in the world. This new powerhouse needed a brand identity that would communicate scale, resources, and capabilities while differentiating itself from dominant competitors.

The new L3Harris brand faced several key challenges:

- Unite the shared vision of two CEOs and leadership teams - Provide a foundation where two systems, cultures, and employee groups could integrate seamlessly - Create a distinctive visual identity in a category dominated by established players - Develop all brand elements in a climate of total confidentiality

As the design, logo, motion, and UI/UX lead at Thackway McCord, I collaborated closely with creative director Kat McCord and design lead David Weiss to guide every phase of development. Our team approached this significant project with a comprehensive strategy that moved from discovery through implementation. The resulting identity system balanced technical precision with forward-looking innovation – reflecting L3Harris's position at the intersection of defense, technology, and aerospace.

The logo design and visual system evoke technological advancement while maintaining the gravitas expected of a major defense contractor. The identity extends cohesively across digital platforms, physical environments, and communications materials – from exhibition booths and signage to digital interfaces and collateral. Throughout the project I remained responsible for design execution across brand, motion, and digital touchpoints.

Conducted extensive research into both legacy brands, competitor analysis, and stakeholder interviews to identify strengths and growth opportunities. The merger represented a significant shift in the competitive landscape, requiring a strategic approach to visual positioning.

Designed the core identity elements including logo, typography, color system, and graphic language. Developed a dynamic system that worked across both digital and physical applications, from aircraft components to trade show displays.

Developed signage systems and exhibition booth designs for major industry events. Created immersive brand experiences that showcased L3Harris technologies while reinforcing the new brand identity.

Created signage systems for L3Harris facilities worldwide, ensuring consistency in brand application across diverse global locations. Developed specifications for illuminated signs, directional systems, and interior brand elements.

Created comprehensive brand guidelines and asset management systems. Provided training and support for global marketing teams to ensure consistent application of the new identity across all touchpoints.

Extended the brand system across a wide range of digital and print touchpoints, including website, social media, and collateral materials. Created templates and assets for ongoing brand application across global teams.

Created dynamic brand animations to introduce the new identity at the merger launch event. These animations visualized the technological sophistication of the new L3Harris entity.

The design process included complex 3D modeling and animation to create a memorable brand reveal moment.

The logo design went through multiple iterations and refinements. The final mark successfully represents the merger of two major companies while positioning the new entity for the future.

Great care lives here. Lifepoint is a national for-profit healthcare provider currently operating in 89 locations across the United States. As design lead at Thackway McCord, I oversaw logo development, motion design, environmental graphics and print applications across the network.

## Main Content

Lifepoint is a national for-profit healthcare provider, operating in 89 communities across the United States. The network is deeply connected to the towns it serves, where hospitals are as vital to local infrastructure as roads and schools.

Working closely with creative director Kat McCord, strategist Simon Thackway and the wider Thackway McCord team, I guided the branding effort from discovery through rollout.

The heart motif created the foundation for a flexible identity system applied through a palette of clean white and vibrant colors. A rigorously developed library of crop configurations originates from the dot motif. The identity system needed to be immediately recognizable while also accommodating diverse healthcare facilities across the country.

As design lead, I partnered with the strategy team to conduct extensive research across stakeholders, patients and healthcare professionals. We audited existing brand assets across numerous facilities to uncover challenges and inconsistencies in the system.

Together with designers Bianca Seong and Fuchen Kuang, I crafted a unified brand platform that accommodated both corporate and local market needs. We developed messaging hierarchies and tone of voice guidelines that supported Lifepoint's positioning as a leader in community healthcare.

I designed a comprehensive visual identity including logo, typography, color palette and supportive graphic elements. Our flexible system could be implemented across diverse facilities while maintaining brand cohesion.

As lead designer I oversaw the redesign of the corporate website and digital touchpoints. We developed user-friendly tools that enhanced patient experience while showcasing Lifepoint's services and expertise.

Guiding the environmental design effort, I created signage systems, wayfinding and environmental graphics for hospitals and healthcare facilities. This cohesive approach to physical spaces improved navigation while reinforcing brand recognition.

I developed comprehensive guidelines and asset management systems, coordinating phased implementation across multiple facilities and providing training and support for marketing teams throughout the network.

Created detailed brand guidelines to ensure consistent application across all touchpoints. My video presentation walked stakeholders through key elements of the identity system.

I extended the brand identity into mobile applications and digital signage, creating a consistent patient experience across all touchpoints. Animated assets were designed for use in digital displays throughout hospital facilities.

Viewbook highlighting the 15-year experience at Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School (LREI).

## Main Content

Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School (LREI) is a progressive, independent school in New York City that spans pre-K through 12th grade. In my role as design lead for print and motion at Thackway McCord, I spearheaded the creation of a compact viewbook under the guidance of creative director Kat McCord. The goal was to capture the spirit of the school's 15-year educational journey and help parents understand the LREI experience.

Starting with a Flickr archive of around 5,000 photos and minimal text, I led the entire design process to craft a pocket-sized publication that showcases the school's unique approach to education. My leadership role included content curation, layout design, and production management. The result is a visually rich, narrative-driven piece that continues to serve as a key recruitment tool.

The project began with an immersive research phase to understand LREI's distinctive philosophy, culture, and community. As design lead, I partnered with the Thackway McCord team to interview faculty, administrators, and parents. The challenge was to distill a 15-year educational journey into a compact format that would resonate with prospective families.

In my role as design lead, I curated thousands of archival photos to capture authentic moments of student engagement, creativity, and community. I worked with our creative team to ensure we represented all age groups and highlighted key transitions in the LREI experience.

As design lead, I emphasized accessibility and narrative flow. We developed a compact format that parents could carry while still providing a comprehensive overview of the school. The layout balanced dynamic student photography with concise text blocks highlighting LREI's progressive approach and community values.

In my role as design lead, I structured the viewbook as a thematic journey through the LREI experience rather than organizing content by grade level. I worked alongside our creative team to ensure each spread focused on different aspects of student life—from classroom engagement to arts, athletics, and community service—showcasing the holistic nature of an LREI education.

As design lead, I guided the entire production phase, fine-tuning layouts, correcting imagery, and refining copy. I directly collaborated with printers to select paper stock that enhanced the photography and stood up to repeated handling. My attention to finishing details created a premium feel that reflected the quality of an LREI education.

The final design captured LREI's progressive approach and vibrant community. With a print run of 10,000 copies, the viewbook became a cornerstone of the school's recruitment materials. Its compact format allowed easy distribution at open houses and admissions events while the engaging visual narrative effectively communicated LREI's unique value to prospective families.

The LREI viewbook I designed has proven to have remarkable longevity, continuing to serve as an effective recruitment tool years after its release. My leadership role in this project shows how thoughtful design can capture timeless aspects of the school experience.

This project demonstrates how my strategic content curation and visual storytelling approach can distill a complex educational journey into an accessible format that resonates with families. My work has helped LREI effectively communicate its values and educational philosophy to prospective parents.

Enterprise renewable energy company rebranding from Goldman Sachs spin-off

## Main Content

MN8 Energy emerged from Goldman Sachs's decision to spin out its renewable energy business, creating a paradigm-shifting opportunity in the clean energy sector. As the enterprise renewable energy leader, MN8 is dedicated to making energy smarter, cleaner, more accessible, and more efficient.

The name "MN8" (pronounced "minute") represents both energy's constant motion and the company's innovative approach to power generation and distribution. The clever phonetic wordplay connects to the concept of time while visually incorporating the number 8, which resembles an infinity symbol when turned horizontally - suggesting unlimited potential.

The logo design features a brilliant negative space treatment where the "8" cleverly doubles as both a colon and a power socket, visually communicating the company's core business of energy delivery. The "all orange everything" brand approach gives MN8 a bold, distinctive presence in an industry often dominated by conservative blue and green palettes.

As the design, logo, motion, and UI/UX lead, I collaborated with the Thackway McCord team—Kat McCord, Steve Clarke, Lucinda Quartararo, Dave Morreale, Simon Thackway, and Jonathan Paisner—to steer the brand from naming through launch.

I worked extensively on naming exploration, logo concepting, website design, design systems implementation, and brand guidelines development. My contributions helped translate the strategic vision into cohesive visual assets that positioned MN8 as a forward-thinking energy innovator.

Conducted collaborative naming workshops to develop a distinctive brand name that would resonate with both corporate clients and consumers. Explored numerous directions before finalizing MN8, which cleverly combines the concept of illumination with a modern, tech-forward sound.

Defined core brand values, positioning, and personality traits that would distinguish MN8 in the competitive energy landscape. Established a strategic framework that highlighted the company's commitment to innovation and sustainability without relying on category clichés.

Designed a comprehensive visual identity system including logo, typography, color palette, and graphic elements. Created a dynamic system that could flex across various touchpoints while maintaining a cohesive brand experience.

Developed website wireframes, UI design, and content strategy that effectively communicated complex energy solutions to diverse audiences. Created interactive elements that showcased MN8's technological capabilities and project portfolio.

The brand comes to life across various touchpoints, from digital platforms to physical locations. MN8 Energy operates solar farms and EV charging stations across the country, with the brand designed to work effectively in these diverse environments.

Produced comprehensive brand guidelines documenting all visual and verbal elements. Developed templates for presentations, reports, and marketing materials to ensure consistent application across the organization.

Coordinated the phased rollout of the new brand across all channels. Provided training and resources for internal teams to ensure adoption and proper implementation of brand standards.

As design, logo, motion, and UI/UX lead, I worked closely with the creative team to iterate on concepts, refine the design system, and ensure all deliverables met both aesthetic and functional requirements. We used Figma for collaborative design work and stakeholder presentations.

Storyboarding and direction for the Onity logo animation

## Main Content

Onity provides digital locking systems and secure access solutions for hotels, businesses, and educational institutions worldwide. As a trusted leader in electronic locks and mobile credentials, they needed a logo animation that would convey security, innovation, and seamless functionality.

I worked with Onity to create a short logo animation that explores energy flow and simplicity, focusing on motion that reinforces their brand attributes of reliability and cutting-edge technology.

Although the overall direction was led by a studio art director, my role in animation and storyboarding included shaping the final motion sequence and preparing case study assets—including the brand animation—before I left the studio midway through the engagement.

The final animation brings energy and motion to the Onity wordmark. Working closely with the Onity design team, I shaped the motion to represent the secure, continuous flow of access control systems. The circular reveal and clean logotype underscore the brand’s modern, technological positioning.

The Onity brand is applied across a variety of digital and physical touchpoints—from mobile apps to marketing materials—and I collaborated with the internal marketing team to ensure the motion elements could be animated or presented statically as needed.

The brand system was designed to be adaptable for social media platforms, with considerations for different aspect ratios and dynamic content presentation that maintains visual consistency.

The project included digital experience design elements, such as this custom 404 error page animation that incorporates the brand's visual language while creating a memorable user interaction.

Comprehensive brand guidelines were developed to ensure consistent application of the visual system across all touchpoints. These guidelines included detailed specifications for logo usage, color palette, typography, and motion principles.

The visual identity system was applied to various marketing materials, creating a cohesive brand experience across different touchpoints and reinforcing the brand's positioning in the security technology sector.

I created detailed storyboards to map out the animation sequence in partnership with our creative director, focusing on the circular reveal and energy flow that would become signature elements of the brand’s motion language. These boards helped communicate the concept to stakeholders before moving into production.

The animation was developed as part of a broader visual identity system. Working with the brand team, we explored how animated elements could extend beyond the logo into other touchpoints to create a cohesive motion language.

Beyond the logo animation, we developed a complete motion system with the Onity team that could be applied across various brand touchpoints. This included animated UI elements, transitions for digital presentations, and video guidelines.

The completed brand identity system included a full set of animation assets, guidelines, and implementation tools. The logo animation has become a central part of the Onity brand experience, appearing on their website, digital products, and marketing materials.

Brand identity for the world's largest pure play paper company

## Main Content

As design lead at Thackway McCord, I worked closely with executive creative director Kat McCord, creative director Steve Clarke and strategists Simon Thackway and Jonathan Paisner to craft the Sylvamo brand. The name was created by Thackway McCord when the business spun off from International Paper, forming the world's largest pure play paper producer.

The brand combines the Latin words for forest, *silva*, and love, *amo*, expressing a deep respect for sustainable forestry. A paper plane icon symbolizes aspiration while a vibrant purple palette sets the identity apart in a sea of green. Throughout the engagement I oversaw logo, motion graphics and print execution.

As design lead, I analyzed the paper industry landscape to identify positioning opportunities for the spin-off. I conducted stakeholder interviews to understand the vision for the new company and differentiation from the parent organization.

Working with the strategy team, I created the distinctive "Sylvamo" name through an extensive development process. We explored numerous linguistic directions before developing the Latin-derived name that elegantly expressed the company's relationship with forests.

I developed dynamic animations with 3D artist Scyld Bowring to bring the new identity to life across digital touchpoints. The paper airplane motif was enhanced through detailed rendering and motion design.

I designed a comprehensive visual system including the distinctive paper plane logo, typography, color palette and graphic elements. The system balanced professionalism with accessibility and avoided category clichés.

I built comprehensive brand guidelines documenting all identity elements and applications. These detailed specifications ensured consistent implementation across global markets and diverse touchpoints.

Leading the design team, I coordinated with International Paper and Sylvamo leadership on phased implementation. We developed launch materials including website, videos, social media and investor relations assets.

I created special animated content for Sylvamo's IPO day celebration at the New York Stock Exchange, bringing the brand to life in a high-energy sequence.

I designed environmental applications for Sylvamo headquarters and production facilities, along with trade show materials, signage systems and experiential elements for global implementation.

Custom QR code illustrations and playful stickers for holiday chocolate bars.

## Main Content

Every holiday season, Thackway McCord partners with an artist to create a series of chocolate bars for clients. In 2021 I pitched drawing custom QR codes linking to fun, branded URLs. Serving as art director, designer, illustrator, motion artist and developer, I transformed these utilitarian codes into playful portraits of pets. The Thackway McCord team collaborated with Monotype to pair Cotford with the glitchy codes, and the gifs even gained traction on Giphy. Most importantly, my cat Bean starred in the case study next to his illustration.

I led concept development with the Thackway McCord team, transforming the ubiquitous QR code—something that had become a utilitarian necessity during the pandemic—into a playful centerpiece. We created hand-drawn codes that doubled as pet portraits, turning a functional element into a delight.

I hand-illustrated each QR code to create a portrait of a pet while maintaining scannability. This required careful consideration of the error correction capabilities of QR codes, allowing for creative manipulation without losing functionality. The designs balanced visual interest with technical requirements.

I designed the chocolate bar packaging to showcase the illustrated QR codes, using a clean typographic approach with Monotype's Cotford typeface. The contrast between elegant typography and playful, glitchy codes created a distinctive look that reflected our team's aesthetic values.

I animated each pet and built landing pages so that scanning a code revealed an 8-bit surprise. These playful moments bridged the physical and digital experience and delighted recipients.

I created a series of stickers featuring the pet illustrations. These extras extended the campaign's life beyond the chocolate consumption, giving recipients a lasting memento and another way to engage with the concept.

I shared the animations on Giphy and other platforms, giving the project additional traction. This organic spread extended the campaign's reach beyond the immediate recipients of the chocolate bars and highlighted our team's innovative approach.

The project delighted clients and received industry recognition, including an Indigo Design Award in 2021 and a Communication Arts Illustration shortlist. Most importantly, it transformed a utilitarian element—the QR code—into an opportunity for creativity and connection for our team.

## Main Content

Tryitout is a semi-professional wiffleball league formed by friends in Brooklyn. As art director, brand designer, motion designer, and ace pitcher, I oversaw the entire look and feel while leading the team on the field.

The logo is a traditional-feeling cursive sports mark, aligned by the identical "t" used at the beginning, middle, and end. Bright green reflects the feeling of playing ball in the yard. Despite our branding efforts, we lost in the semi-finals to a squad of 16-year-olds.

The visual identity process began with exploring typography that could convey both athleticism and a sense of community. The resulting logo features bold, condensed lettering with a distinctive angle suggesting forward momentum, complemented by a palette of primary colors reminiscent of classic baseball design.

The most distinctive aspect of the brand was the player trading card system. Each participant—Kevin, Dennis, Lats and Leela—received a personalized card with custom stats and photography, reinforcing team identity and creating collectible memorabilia.

Jerseys and t-shirts were produced to further establish the league's identity. These items carried the logo and colors consistently, building team spirit and attracting attention.

We set up a website and social channels to share schedules, results and highlight videos. The digital content mirrored the brand's visual language across all touchpoints.

Branded scorecards, signage and other materials turned casual park games into more structured events, enhancing the atmosphere for players and spectators.

What began as a weekend activity grew into a recognizable brand with its own community, showing how thoughtful design can transform grassroots recreation.

Crafting a bold brand identity for a recreational sports league

## Main Content

Try It Out is a semi-professional wiffleball league formed by a group of friends in Brooklyn who transformed a casual weekend activity into an organized competitive venture with its own distinctive visual identity. The brand development embraced both the DIY spirit of the league and the nostalgic connection to classic sports card collecting, creating a cohesive system that worked across physical and digital touchpoints.

The core challenge was balancing the playful, grassroots nature of the sport with a professional-looking identity system that would elevate the experience for participants and spectators alike.

The visual identity process began with exploring typography that could convey both athleticism and a sense of community. The resulting logo system features bold, condensed lettering with a distinctive angle that suggests forward momentum—a key attribute for a sports brand. The typography system was complemented by a color palette dominated by bold primary colors reminiscent of classic baseball design language.

The most distinctive aspect of the Try It Out brand was the player trading card system. Each league participant received their own personalized trading card featuring portrait photography against a vibrant background and custom stats. The cards served multiple purposes: they reinforced team identity, created collectible memorabilia, and provided a novel way to introduce players to one another at events.

To further establish the league's identity, a limited run of merchandise was created, including jerseys and t-shirts. The apparel featured the Try It Out logo prominently and used the established color palette consistently. These items weren't just promotional materials—they helped create a sense of community and team spirit among participants while increasing visibility in public spaces.

The league established a digital presence through social media and a simple website to announce game schedules, share results, and showcase player profiles. The digital content maintained the brand's visual language established in the physical assets, creating a consistent experience across all touchpoints. Short promotional videos were created for social sharing, featuring highlights from games and player interviews.

The brand identity extended to the in-person experience at games, where branded scorecards, signage, and other game-day materials helped create an immersive atmosphere. These elements transformed what could have been a casual park gathering into a more structured sporting event, enhancing the experience for both players and spectators.

What began as a casual weekend activity evolved into a recognizable brand with its own community. The Try It Out league demonstrates how thoughtful design can elevate even grassroots recreational activities into meaningful experiences. The project showcases the power of branding to transform simple gatherings into organized communities with shared identity and purpose.

Visual identity for the 73rd President of the General Assembly

## Main Content

In 2018, the United Nations President of the General Assembly (PGA) initiated a new diplomatic dialogue format called "Morning Minga" to foster more collaborative and informal exchanges between UN representatives. This innovative project required a comprehensive brand identity that would honor the UN's diplomatic gravitas while introducing a fresh, approachable visual language for this new initiative.

The Morning Minga dialogues represented a significant shift in diplomatic communication at the UN, creating spaces where ambassadors and representatives could engage in more personal, candid discussions about pressing global issues outside the formal assembly structure. Our team was tasked with developing a complete brand identity package that would:

- Create a distinctive visual identity that balanced UN heritage with a fresh, contemporary approach - Design flexible branding elements that could be implemented across physical and digital touchpoints - Develop a system that would appeal to diplomats from diverse cultural backgrounds - Establish brand guidelines that could be consistently applied by the UN's internal team

As design lead at Thackway McCord, I worked with creative director Kat McCord and strategist Simon Thackway to develop the logo, digital applications, and print collateral for Morning Minga.

The resulting identity system centered on a vibrant, multi-colored logo that symbolized dialogue and diversity, while maintaining clear connections to UN visual traditions. The name "Minga" itself, referring to a South American tradition of community gatherings, perfectly captured the initiative's collaborative spirit.

We began with extensive research into UN protocols and the PGA's vision for these innovative dialogue sessions. The name "Minga" - referring to a South American tradition of community gatherings - provided an authentic connection to the President's Ecuadorian heritage while embodying the collaborative spirit of the initiative.

We developed a vibrant, multi-colored logo system that represented dialogue, diversity, and the global nature of the UN community. The design balanced formal diplomatic requirements with a fresh, contemporary approach that felt distinctly different from traditional UN communications.

A key component of the identity was an animated logo that brought energy and movement to digital applications. The animation concept reflected the gathering of diverse perspectives coming together in dialogue - central to the Morning Minga concept.

We created a comprehensive suite of materials including banners, leaflets, and diplomatic correspondence templates. These materials needed to function in multiple languages and adhere to strict UN protocol while still conveying the fresh, inclusive spirit of the Morning Minga sessions.

The brand extended to digital platforms including social media graphics, email templates, and presentation decks. These were designed to be easily adaptable by the UN's internal communications team while maintaining visual consistency.

The identity was implemented throughout key UN spaces, including the General Assembly hall and meeting rooms. Environmental applications needed to respect the historic architecture while creating a recognizable presence for the Morning Minga initiative.

The Morning Minga identity was highly successful, receiving praise from diplomats and UN staff for its ability to balance tradition with innovation. The format and branding became a signature initiative of the 73rd PGA, helping to foster more collaborative dialogue among member states.
